I'm a 33-year-old computer engineer from Norway. I currently live in Hamar, where I work for Red Hat as a software engineer. When I am not sitting in front of my computer (which is not very often), I enjoy hiking, playing guitar, listening to music and spending time with my wife, our sons, and our dogs Scala and Ompa
