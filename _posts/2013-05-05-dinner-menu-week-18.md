This time I thought I'd share our dinner plans for the next week. We take turns
creating dinner list every week, and next week is my turn! 

* Monday: Tortellini with sun dried tomatoes and mozzarella
* Tuesday: Fish with avocado, ruccola salad and hot mustard
* Wednesday: Fennel soup with chicken
* Thursday: Albondigas
* Friday: Salmon with fennelrisotto
* Saturday: Breaded cod with salad and potatoes
* Sunday: Home made tomato soup

Lets hope it tastes as good as I think it does.
