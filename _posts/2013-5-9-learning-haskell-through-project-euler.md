I have tried using Haskell to various smaller projects, such as
[wishsys](https://github.com/lulf/wishsys) and a game that I never got really
far into making. But learning a new programming language through the means of
hobby projects only work as long as the project is contained and small. For my
part, most hobby projects start out with great ideas and grand designs, but end
up as a mess since I am unfamiliar with the programming language.

When using a new programming language, time is spent learning the language
rather than developing the project. This in turn means that I end up learning
the bare minimum to get the job done. And this defeats the purpose of using a
project to learn a new language. If the goal is to finish the project, you
should have used something you know well and feel most productive with. If the
goals is to learn a programming language, you should start out with a small
project instead.

For me, [project euler](http://projecteuler.net/) is a great way to learn
Haskell, because it contains a lot of problems that Haskell (and functional
languages in general) is the perfect tool for solving.  The projects I mentioned
above involves using databases, multiple threads and other scary real world
stuff, but I just wanted to learn Haskell. And better yet, once you have solved
a problem, chances are you can find someone with an even more elegant solution
written in the same programming language you are using. A great way to learn!
