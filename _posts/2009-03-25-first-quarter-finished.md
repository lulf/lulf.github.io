Phew, the first quarter of my exchange study is almost over. So far, the stay
here in the Netherlands have been very exciting. First of all, we did an awesome
project creating a quad rotor controller using a joystick to fly. A demo of the
previous years group can be found
[here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq2XS7oU7tk). We were actually able to
make it work like in this video. The hardware consists of a Xilinx Spartan 3E
starter kit running the X32 CPU core developed here at TU-Delft, a PC with
serial link to the FPGA board, a joystick connected to the PC, and the Quad
Rotor itself connected to the FPGA board via a modified serial link. We
implemented the control software, signal filtering etc on the X32 in C, and
after optimizations, we had a cycle time almost half of the required, and it
flew!

The other course I've been taking is a seminar on wireless sensor network, which
handled nearly all aspects of this topic, having students present a paper on a
certain topic each week. I presented a paper on reliable energy aware routing,
which was very interesting.

Lastly, I have a course in distributed algorithms, which will finish on April
the 4th with an exam. The course teaches various distributed algorithms for
synchronization, global state detection, deadlock, locking etc, and goes through
several P2P protocols as well.

After this quarter I'll also go home to Norway for a short vacation, finally :)
