After Arnar Mar Sig posted his patchset for an initial skeleton of the AVR32
port almost a year ago, things started to catch speed in the beginning of this
year. The work is done in
[perforce](http://p4web.freebsd.org/@md=d&cd=//&c=RbF@//depot/projects/avr32/?ac=83),
and is progressing well. Currently, the system boots and recognizes most of the
hardware, but linker work is required to be able to run init.

So far, I've been working on busdma support, grabbing the source from the mips
port and adjusting it as well as implementing support for cache operations on
the AVR32. It seems to work for now, as Arnar was able to get the ate(4) device
driver to work with it.

The last work have been to design and implement a generic device clock
framework. This is supposed to be used with devices in an architecture
independent way, so that devices can be associated with a clock without knowing
what clock it is (assigned internally for each architecture). This is necessary
for a few devices to avoid #ifdefs all over the place. For instance, the
at91_mci device is identical to the one used in AVR32, and it gets the clock
frequency based on at91 machine dependant defines.  Another property of this
would be to export clocks using this interface to userland (AVR32 have a set of
generic clocks as well).
