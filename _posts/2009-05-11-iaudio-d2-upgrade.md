title: "Iaudio d2 upgrade"

Last year in Japan I bought a Cowon iAudio D2 player, which have proven to be
quite good. But a few days ago, I thought I'd try to upgrade the firmware of it.
I then discovered that there are four different types of firmware depending on
where you bought it. As I bought it in Japan, my firmware was not compatible
with other firmwares. The reason for this are mostly due to small differences in
hardware. In my case, I have the possiblity of watching Japanese television (not
really useful in Norway).

Therefore, I thought I would try and upgrade to the european firmware (a lot
more fixes get through to this firmware it seems), but I was a bit afraid I
would brick it if it was the case. I looked around at the iaudiophile forums,
and finally I found someone with the same attempt, and they succeeded.  The
procedure was easy, but to be able to use the european firmware, I had to rename
them to have the same file name as the Japanese, in order for the player to pick
them up.  Luckily, it worked for me too. Phew!
