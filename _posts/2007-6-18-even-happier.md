Finally I did the initalization code for raid5 plexes, and this means I'm pretty much complete with updating old gvinum to the new event system, but it will probably need some fixes here and there as it gets tested.

What remains in terms of needed functionality is the concat/mirror/stripe commands to easily create a concat/mirror/stripe volume out of three disks. I also have noted some issues that I think could need an improvement. More on this next time.
