Today, I'm sitting in a caf√© in Oslo, waiting until we're leaving for Gardermoen
and our flight back to the Netherlands after one week vacation in Norway. The
weather was nice, and I got to do some skiing at least. However, I was 
actually supposed to be in the Netherlands already. The reason that I'm not, is
that we (my girlfriend and I) missed the flight on Sunday. We actually missed it
by one day, as we were 100% sure that we were leaving yesterday, so when we
showed up at the airport, we were shocked to learn that we were 24 hours late!
This was a silly mistake, as neither of us really looked at the date, we always
assumed that we were leaving on Monday. Unfortunately, to be able to board the
flight that we assumed was our flight, we had to pay 3000 NOK extra per ticket!
In other words, we had to find other ways of getting back. Luckily, we got to
stay at my sister place last night, and got new tickets for today's flight at
approximately the same price as our original tickets (700 NOK per ticket).
Hopefully, we'll be back in our apartment tonight :)
